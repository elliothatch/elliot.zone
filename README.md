# elliot.zone
My personal website, [elliot.zone](https://elliot.zone). Built with the website creation tool i am developing, [Hypermedium](https://github.com/elliothatch/hypermedium).

## install
```
yarn
```

Until hypermedium is published on npm, you will need to build it from source and use `yarn link`.

## run live server
```
yarn dev
```
or
```
yarn start
```

## export static HTML
```
yarn build
```
