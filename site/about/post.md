Hello! I am Elliot, and this is my Elliot Zone. Welcome!

I'm a software engineer specializing in full-stack web development, DevOps, and server administration. I also have interests in embedded systems, game development, CAD, 3D printing, visual design, and circuit and PCB design. I live in Salt Lake City.

When I'm not working on websites and open source projects, I'm probably sticking RGB LEDs in things, designing objects to 3D print, or playing the piano.

You'll find some of my projects and open source code here on [elliot.zone](https://elliot.zone). The biggest project I'm working on right now is [Hypermedium](https://github.com/elliothatch/hypermedium), a tool for building websites. I used it to make this website! Wow!

If you'd like to contact me, you can try one of the links at the bottom of the page. I also have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliothatch).
